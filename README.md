# Haskell_project
This is a project for COM2108 functional programming course that was written in Haskell.
# The Project objective
the project objective was to build an auto-solve programm in Haskell for the game 8-of-solitaire.
# The development process
the process was:
  1- design the game fully using tables and diagrams while writing the report.
  2- start implementing the design in Haskell using vscode.
  3- modify and improve design while testing the code and make changes where needed.
# The final result
the resulting programm functions partially, it can auto-solve many games but for some, it will enter infinit loops depending on the intial random seed it was given to start the game. 
Hopefully I will debug and correct the solution in the future at my own time. 
# What I have learned
Haskell is a very fun programming language that offered me a new experience different than using OO languages such as Java.
writing the design and brainstorming before implementing anything is key to good results.
I learned that I'm a person who likes to be self-taught and enjoy the process of learning new things and getting good at it!.
